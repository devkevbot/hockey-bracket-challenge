## Guide

### Making predictions

1. Visit https://hockey-bracket-challenge.vercel.app/
1. Click "Sign in" and sign in with your Discord account
1. For each available series, select your prediction

### Prediction outcomes

Your "score" is based on how correct you were; maximum points are earned for guessing _both_ the correct series winner _and_ the correct series length in games.

The breakdown is as follows:

- **Exactly correct** Both the series winner and series length is correct.
- **Partially correct** Only the series winner or series length is correct.
- **Incorrect** Both the series winner and series length is incorrect.
